# Hand Detection with MediaPipe and OpenCV

This is a hand detector powered by MediaPipe from Google. The MediaPipe handtracking model was trained on 33,000 keypoint-annotated images and is therefore provides extremely accurate tracking. I have added a module that plots the points in matplotlib so we can see the points being tracked.

## Requirements:
Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Numpy
